// Q . 12: Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person's name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person's name.

let names: string[] = ["Ahmed Raza", "Farrukh", "Fahad"];
let message: string = "beleives that EGO is not important but SELF RESPECT is most important";
console.log(names[0] + " " + message);
console.log(names[1] + " " + message);
console.log(names[2] + " " + message);
